complete this project , first read it fully , and then
the server side application must handle these :
webpanel and client application backend
redis database
vpn protocols handling
now I'm ggoing to explain each one 
first of all database , database must save these data [ status , uptime , last sync time , clients ( each client have these : status , username , password , trafficlimit , timelimit , onhold or not , allowed protocols , used traffic , lastip , last connect time ) , core configs ( each vpn protocol got specefic config and also candyconnect have config itself , now I'm going to explain each one , for candyconnect it will have ( log level , mode ( normal , fast , slow ) , auto backup , backupinterval ) , for wireguard ( it will be able to have diffrent interfaces ( dns , ip subnet , port , mtu ) ) , for v2ray ( itt will have only a json as xray config ) , for openvpn ( port , protocol ( udp or tcp ) , dns , subnet , keepalive ) , for ikev2 ( port , natport , dns , subnet ) , for l2tp ( port , ipsecport , psk , localip , remote-range , dns , mtu , mru ) , for dnstt ( port , domain , dns , ttl , maxpayload ) , slipstream ( port , fastopen ( true , false ) , timeout , nodelay , udpRelay ) , for trust tunnel ( port , protocol , camouflage , sni , timeout ) ) , Traffic ( itt will have the usage on each vpn protocol with client id soo it will contain ( clientid , used traffic , protocol , last ip , last online ) ) , Panel configs ( panel port , panel path , panel version , panel username and password hashed ) ]

now I will below say how does each proottcol runs : in server backend create a full function to install each protocol

wireguard => first installing wireguard ( sudo apt update && sudo apt install wireguard -y ) , create .conf file and then ( sudo systemctl enable wg-quick@wg0 && sudo systemctl start wg-quick@wg0 )
v2ray => downloads xray froom it's github repo and put it in path , and then it will be runs using xray -c xray.json
openvpn => write it urself
ikev2 => write it urself , fully and working
l2tp => write it urself
dntss => read https://github.com/bugfloyd/dnstt-deploy to learn how to setup ( it must be with ssh and create an not root user and password for each user )
slipstream => no need now
trustunnel => no need now

you must create classes and functions to handle each vpn prootocol core , work with and contorol user and also track their usage on each protocl and calcualte the overall used and put it in database

webpanel backend must be a full api for web-panel frontend ( right now it uses an api but dont care and create your own and change it ) , every thing must work prefectly in web-panel , everything must be complete and working , be real I mean , it must have good error handling so user will findout what's happening ( everything I mean even prtocol cores must work really like adding interface fr wireguard or anything else )
client backend must be connected to database and web-panel backend , user will login and it gives token to user , then using that token it will get infoormatin about user and all of the vpn prtocol configs for user to use

and now the installation

install.sh msut deploy the server candyconnect core and web-panel and then the rest must be done by candyconnect core
no need to build candyconnect , it must just use the builded one

start complting this project , fully without any bug , entirely and everything works prefectly
it must be optimize az much as possible
