## 🌐 Web Panel

The admin web panel provides full server management:

- **Dashboard** — Server resources, VPN core status, active connections per protocol, real traffic stats, live logs
- **Clients** — Create, edit, delete VPN users with per-protocol access control, traffic limits, time limits, and connection history
- **Core Configs** — Configure each VPN protocol (ports, ciphers, keys, interfaces, DNS, etc.)
- **Panel Configs** — Change panel port/path, admin password, view server info

### Access

Open `http://<SERVER_IP>:8443/candyconnect` in your browser.

Default credentials:
- **Username:** `admin`
- **Password:** `admin123`

---

## 💻 Desktop Client

The CandyConnect desktop client (built with Tauri + React) connects to the server backend and provides a native VPN experience on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

### Supported Client Protocols

| Protocol | TUN Mode | Proxy Mode |
|---|---|---|
| V2Ray (VLESS/VMess/Trojan) | ✅ via sing-box | ✅ via Xray SOCKS |
| WireGuard | ✅ via sing-box | ✅ via sing-box |
| OpenVPN | ✅ Native | — |
| IKEv2 | ✅ Native | — |
| L2TP | ✅ Native | — |
| DNSTT | ✅ via tunnel | — |

### How It Works

1. User enters the server address (e.g., `http://your-server:8443`)
2. Logs in with their client username/password (created via the web panel)
3. The client fetches available VPN protocols and connection configs
4. User selects a protocol and mode (TUN/Proxy) and connects
5. Real-time speed and traffic stats are shown — **only VPN interface traffic is counted** (not general system traffic)

### Building the Client

```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run dev          # Development mode
npm run build        # Production build (Tauri)
```

> **Note:** Building the Tauri desktop app requires Rust and platform-specific dependencies. See [Tauri Prerequisites](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/).

## 🖥 Server Management

### Service Commands

```bash
# Check status
sudo systemctl status candyconnect

# Restart
sudo systemctl restart candyconnect

# View live logs
sudo journalctl -u candyconnect -f

# Stop
sudo systemctl stop candyconnect
```

### Configuration

Server configuration is stored in `/opt/candyconnect/.env`:

```env
CC_DATA_DIR=/opt/candyconnect
CC_REDIS_URL=redis://127.0.0.1:6379/0
CC_JWT_SECRET=<auto-generated>
CC_PANEL_PORT=8443
CC_PANEL_PATH=/candyconnect
CC_ADMIN_USER=admin
CC_ADMIN_PASS=admin123
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Checking Protocol Status

```bash
# WireGuard
sudo wg show

# Xray
sudo /opt/candyconnect/cores/xray/xray run -c /opt/candyconnect/cores/xray/config.json

# IKEv2/IPSec
sudo ipsec statusall
sudo swanctl --list-conns

# OpenVPN
sudo tail -f /var/log/openvpn/openvpn-status.log

# L2TP
sudo journalctl -u xl2tpd -f

# DNSTT
ps aux | grep dnstt-server
```

### ⚙️ Manual Service Control

```bash
# WireGuard interface
sudo wg-quick down wg0
sudo wg-quick up wg0

# IPSec (IKEv2/L2TP)
sudo systemctl restart strongswan-starter

# L2TP Daemon
sudo systemctl restart xl2tpd

# SSH (for DNSTT tunnels)
sudo systemctl restart ssh
```

### 🆘 Emergency Port Release

If a protocol fails to start because "Port is already in use":
```bash
sudo lsof -i :<PORT_NUMBER>
# or
sudo netstat -tulpn | grep :<PORT_NUMBER>
```

---

## 🔒 VPN Protocol Setup

After installation, VPN protocols need to be installed and started via the web panel or API:

### Via Web Panel

1. Go to **Core Configs**
2. Configure each protocol's settings
3. Click **Save Config**
4. Use the **Restart Service** button (or install first if not yet installed)

### Via API

```bash
TOKEN="your-admin-jwt-token"
SERVER="http://your-server:8443"

# Install & start all protocols
for proto in v2ray wireguard openvpn ikev2 l2tp dnstt; do
  curl -X POST "$SERVER/api/cores/$proto/install" -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
  curl -X POST "$SERVER/api/cores/$proto/start" -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
done
```

---

## 🌐 DNSTT Setup (DNS Tunnel)

DNSTT allows VPN traffic to be tunneled over DNS queries, bypassing most firewalls. It requires you to own a domain and configure two DNS records.

### DNS Records Required

You must add the following records to your domain's DNS settings:

| Type | Name | Value | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| **A** | `srv.YOURDOMAIN.COM` | `YOUR_SERVER_IP` | Points to your CandyConnect server |
| **NS** | `dns.YOURDOMAIN.COM` | `srv.YOURDOMAIN.COM` | Delegates DNS queries to your server |

**Example** (domain: `example.com`, server IP: `1.2.3.4`):

```
A     srv.example.com   →   1.2.3.4
NS    dns.example.com   →   srv.example.com
```

### How It Works

1. The client sends DNS queries to `dns.YOURDOMAIN.COM`
2. The NS record delegates those queries to `srv.YOURDOMAIN.COM` (your server)
3. Your server's DNSTT daemon handles the queries and tunnels VPN traffic through them
4. Traffic appears as normal DNS UDP port 53 traffic — bypasses most deep packet inspection

### DNSTT Configuration in Web Panel

1. Go to **Core Configs → DNSTT**
2. Set **DNS Zone** to `dns.YOURDOMAIN.COM`
3. Set **Listen Port** (default: `5300` for DNS; port 53 requires root)
4. Save and start the DNSTT core

> **Note:** Propagation of DNS records can take up to 24–48 hours depending on your registrar's TTL settings. Test with `dig NS dns.yourdomain.com` to confirm.

## 👥 Client Management

### Creating a Client

Via the web panel:
1. Go to **Clients** → **Add Client**
2. Set username, password, traffic limit, time limit
3. Select which VPN protocols the client can access
4. Click **Create**

Via API:
```bash
curl -X POST "$SERVER/api/clients" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "username": "john",
    "password": "SecurePass123!",
    "comment": "John Doe",
    "enabled": true,
    "traffic_limit": {"value": 50, "unit": "GB"},
    "time_limit": {"mode": "days", "value": 30, "on_hold": false},
    "protocols": {
      "v2ray": true, "wireguard": true, "openvpn": true,
      "ikev2": true, "l2tp": false, "dnstt": false,
      "slipstream": false, "trusttunnel": false
    }
  }'
```

### Client Features

- **Traffic Limits** — Per-client data caps in GB or MB
- **Time Limits** — Expiry in days or months
- **On Hold** — Pause a client's timer without deleting them
- **Per-Protocol Access** — Enable/disable individual VPN protocols per client
- **Real Traffic Tracking** — Per-protocol usage tracking (client-reported + server-measured)
- **Active Connections** — Real-time connection count per protocol in the dashboard
- **Connection History** — IP, protocol, duration logging
